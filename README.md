# MYTH DAO
First 'dream factory' in the DAO Era

For thousands of years, humans have tried many different mechanisms to resolve disputes and collaborate towards shared goals.
However, besides the technology platforms that we have at hand, not much has changed in how humans organize ourselves and 
go about collaborating. Centralization of power and authority has been a useful way to establish set rules and systems for
how we do business, set rules, and all sorts of other discourse. While groups may be working towards shared goals, individuals
also have their own motives and can exert their own will once they gain a small majority of power and even undermine the overall
group itself. \
Now, for the first time in history, people of different environments and circumstances  have the opportunity to participate
in the establishment and continuation of governance without the need to trust some failable leader that will have the
final say in how things are run, which ultimately comes with a distortion of interests, fractioning, and untold amounts
of energy spent on electing, monitoring, and replacing them. Instead, we have DAO.
